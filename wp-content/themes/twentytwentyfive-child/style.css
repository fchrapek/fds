/*
 * CUSTOM CSS STRATEGY:
 * 
 * The theme uses Vite for asset compilation, so SCSS files in assets/scss/
 * are the recommended location for most custom styles. This approach provides:
 * - Modular organization
 * - SCSS preprocessing capabilities
 * - Automatic minification and optimization
 * - Hot reloading during development
 *
